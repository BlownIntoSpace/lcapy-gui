Installation
============


1. Lcapy-gui (and its Python dependencies) can be installed using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install lcapy-gui

This will automatically download Lcapy and the other required Python
packages.  However, if you wish to create PDF and PNG images, you will
need to install LaTeX and Circuitikz (see
https://lcapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).


Installation of latest version
==============================

If you wish to install the latest version from the git repository use:

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/mph-/lcapy-gui.git#egg=lcapy-gui

However, it is better to fork or clone the git repository if you wish to make fixes.
