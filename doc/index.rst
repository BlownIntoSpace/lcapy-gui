Welcome to Lcapy-gui's documentation!
=====================================

The Lcapy-gui package provides the lcapy-tk program.  Schematics can
be created and saved in a number of formats and symbolic component
voltages and currents can be inspected.

Lcapy-tk utilizes Lcapy for symbolic linear circuit analysis and
signal-processing, see https://lcapy.readthedocs.io.

If you have suggestions for improvements, please create an issue at
https://github.com/mph-/lcapy-gui/issues.

If you are using Lcapy for teaching, please email to `''.join(reversed(['nz', '.', 'ac', '.', 'canterbury', '@', 'hayes', '.', 'michael']))`.

To cite Lcapy in publications use `Hayes M. 2022. Lcapy: symbolic linear circuit analysis with Python. PeerJ Computer Science 8:e875` https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.875
